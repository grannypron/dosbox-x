This project stemmed from a question on the Reddit r/goldbox forums about whether the Enlarge spell had any effect on a 18(00) character.

Because the source is (hopefully) locked away somewhere, we can't see the exact game mechanics without going through the assembly line by line and trying to make sense of it.  But, I figured that an inductive approach may work.  Since PoR runs in DOSBox now, I figured we could somehow automate a battle and record the results each time to see, with and without Enlarge cast, what the damage would be.  This is that automation effort and its results.




Notes:
 I did not take into effect the to-hit rolls.  Only hit rolls where damage was inflicted are counted.
